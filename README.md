[![Linter](https://github.com/kaamosdao/glsl-animation-cases/actions/workflows/linter.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kaamosdao/glsl-animation-cases/actions/workflows/linter.yml)

This project will contain some animations, i've learned using glsl shaders. Will be replenished over time.

Tools i used here:

- [React](https://react.dev/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for interfaces and routes,
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for scene,
- [GSAP](https://greensock.com/) and glsl shaders for animations.
